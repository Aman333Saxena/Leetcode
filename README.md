# Leetcode: June LeetCoding Challenge

## Introduction:
This Challenge is beginner-friendly and available to both Premium and non-Premium users. It consists of 30 daily problems over the month of June. A problem is added here each day, and you have 24 hours to make a valid submission for it in order to be eligible for rewards.


## Rules:
In order to be eligible for prizes, you must comply with all the Challenge rules.

- ## Valid submission: 
   Only problems where a valid submission is made will be eligible for rewards. This means the submission was:
within the valid time period for that problem; this is before 23:59 PM PDT on the day it appeared.
made within this **Explore Card**. If you have completed the question previously, you will need to re-submit an answer within this Explore Card.
given the judgement "Accepted" when submitted. Please note that if your submission receives a different judgement, including, but not limited to, Wrong Answer or Time Limit Exceeded, you are allowed to resubmit, as long as it's still within the valid time period.
After making a valid submission for a problem, a blue checkmark will appear next to that problem in the left bar. A grey cross means that a valid submission was not made on time for that problem, and so, unfortunately, you're no longer eligible for prizes for that problem.


- ## Late or invalid submissions: 
  Will not be accepted under any circumstances. It is your responsibility to make a valid submission for a problem within its valid time period, and to confirm that the blue checkmark has appeared.

- ## Rewards: 
  Only valid submissions will be eligible for rewards. For more information about the rewards, check out the Discuss post.

- ## Disclaimer: 
  LeetCode reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to disqualify any entries where we believe a user undermines the fairness of this June's LeetCoding Challenge event, which includes, but is not limited to, copying and pasting solutions from other places directly into your submission.
